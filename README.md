# React Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio was created using React to showcase the pseudo-routing capability of React and also to provide a working portfolio of my work so far. 

## Description
The requirements for this assignment were to build a personal website using React that showcased multiple "pages" for an about me section, a resume, a portfolio showcase, and a contact page with interactive form. The project does not yet feature a backend so the form doesn't connect but that will be coming in future iterations.
